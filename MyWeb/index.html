        <h3 style = "font-weight: 500;">Hi! My name is <span class = "pu">Kathy Guo</span> |
        Welcome to my <span class = "pu">Personal Website!</span></h3>
        <p>I'm a 2029 Cornell University Arts & Sciences (CAS) student and graduated TJHSST in 2025!
            At Cornell, I hope to double major in chemistry and CS! Though, I also hope to apply for the College Scholar 
            major at CAS during Fall 2026 so I can focus more on my study of renewable energy sources. 
            I'm currently interested in learning more about CS and using AI to find new energy pathways.
            However, I'm also using my time to learn more about different CS languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
        </p>
        <p>My other hobbies include games, spending time with people, and puzzles! I like playing all different 
            types of games, especially when there's math or strategy involved.
            I like to have fun with other people, to bring groups of people together, and to connect with each other.
            One of my hobbies is just listening to people talk about their viewpoints and perspectives, so I can 
            understand them better and help them achieve their goals. I also love to do different types of puzzles, 
            ranging from regular jigsaw puzzles to the online NYT puzzles. I enjoy a mentally stimulating
            challenge that is fun to solve! More importantly, I enjoy solving a hard puzzle together with other people,
            so that I can hear others' ideas and create a deeper bond between people. I love tackling challenging problems
            with a group so that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow as a person!
        </p>
        <p>My current goals include trying to find a way to make renewable energies more sustainable. Currently, there 
            are problems with storage, conversion, and transportation of these energies that prevent them from becoming 
            our society's main energy source. My goal is to research those barriers and help renewable energies become
            more efficient and sustainable. Another goal of mine is to develop more technologies that help fix our
            world's greatest issues. This includes renewable energy sources but not just. A smaller goal of mine is to 
            help other people in need! I'm always down to help others in need on almost anything so contact me and we can 
            get started!

                <h3>Cyclodextrin Metal Organic Framework 1 (CD-MOF-1) on the Rate of Carbon Dioxide Absorption</h3>
                <p>Tested the efficiency of CD-MOF-1 with multiple amines on carbon dioxide absorption.
                    CD-MOF-1 helps capture carbon dioxide by trapping it in it's porous structures. Amines help reduce
                    carbon dioxide to carbonate by acting as a base on water 
                    (Amine + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> → Amine<sup>+</sup> + 
                    H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Used MDEA (N-Methyldiethanolamine), 
                    1,6-Hexanediamine, and EDTA (Ethylenediamine triacetic acid). Found that EDTA performed best
                    and that CD-MOF-1 lowered efficiency when combined with amines. Though, trials were limited and more 
                    research should be done. CREDIT: TJHSST Chemistry Research Lab

                <h3>Polarization Dependent Photoelectrochemistry of Anisotropic Rhenium Disulfide</h3>
                <p>Worked with conducting Rhenium Disulfide, a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family.
                    These two-dimensional materials have high surface area and tunability, which make them excellent photocatalysts.
                    ReS2, especially, has a rhenium diamond shaped structure which changes depending on the axis viewed. Tested
                    the different axes of ReS2 when shined with light using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). Found
                    that maximum current was achieved when the light's electric field aligned with the rhenium diamond structure's long
                    end (the b-axis). The more ReS2 layers stacked, the less of a difference the alignment made. CREDIT: GMU Chemistry

                <h3>Application of Zinc Copper Indium Sulfide Quantum Dots (ZCIS QDs) in Solar Cells</h3>
                <p>Created different sized ZCIS QDs and measured their efficiency against different colors of light. Different
                    sized QDs were created by extracting them at different time intervals. Darker QDs (more red) were 
                    taken out later than lighter ones (more  yellow). Ran fluorescence spectroscopy using 420 nm excitation value
                    to determine peak wavelength and band gap of each QD, then found radius. Tested different colors of light 
                    using sticky notes on top of a constant light source. Found that middle-sized QDs absorbed light the best.
                    All QDs showed that they absorb more purple light versus other colors. In addition, white light was absorbed
                    the best for all QDs. CREDIT: TJHSST Chemistry Research Lab Senior Research

                <h3>This Website!</h3>
                <p>This is my first webpage that I've made after learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for 1 month (only static)! 
                    Because I'm just starting out, some of the displays on different screen sizes may be inconsistent.
                    I've tested with different types of displays (flex/block...) and changing the screen size may affect
                    elements differently depending on which section is viewed. For best viewing purposes, this website
                    should be looked at on a larger aspect-ratio device (computer/laptop) or a smaller one (phone). anything
                    in between messes up some of the displays (like viewing on a square device). I'm still learning more about
                    web development but will leave this website as it is to display the progress I've made in 1 month! Though,
                    I will still update this website with my projects, skills, and records since it also serves as a personal
                    website for me to use.<br><br> The next few sections are the ones I use for my own personal planning and for
                    easy accessibility. It's also for friends/family to see. But feel free to browse and see the features!
